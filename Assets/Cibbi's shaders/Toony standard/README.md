Welcome to Toony Standard, a toon shader with some standard elements built mainly for VRChat!

## Shader features
* Toon shading with custom ramps.
* Fake light fallbacks for VRChat worlds without a directional light.
* Rim light and emissive rim light.
* Support for both metallic and specular workflows, with the possibility to substitute the specular probe with your own matcap or cubemap.
* Anisotropic highlights.
* Detail mapping.

## Editor features

* Fully custom inspector made to make your life as easy as possible.
* Different levels of inspector with different feature sets based on the end user experience with unity.
* Different styles for your inspector.
* Auto updater.

(to modify some of these options you can go to the settings window on "window/Toony standard/setting")


### Warning
Even if directly downloading the zip should work fine, i suggest you to download the shader from the [release page](https://github.com/Cibbi/Toony-standard/releases), this is to be sure to have it installed in an easy to find path, and also cause i tend to add some starting matcap textures and toon ramps into the unity package that are not available from the github auto generated zip.
